# Route 2 endgame — integer separation from per-`ℓ` congruences (Silverman V.2.3.1, Step 7)

This file ships **Step 7** of the Weil-pairing route to the Hasse bound: the purely
arithmetic *integer-separation* lemma that lifts a family of mod-`ℓ` congruences (one per auxiliary
prime `ℓ ≠ p`) to an equality of integers.

The whole Weil-pairing content of Route 2 — the determinant–degree congruence
`det(ψ | E[ℓ]) ≡ deg ψ (mod ℓ)` — feeds into this lemma as the per-`ℓ` hypothesis.  Concretely,
once the finite-level pairing gives `deg(rπ − s) ≡ qr² − t·rs + s² (mod ℓ)` for every prime `ℓ ≠ p`,
`int_eq_of_congr_all_primes_ne` yields the **integer** identity `deg(rπ − s) = qr² − t·rs + s²`,
which (being a value of `deg`) is `≥ 0` — closing Leaf 1.

This isolates the Weil pairing as the single residual: everything *downstream* of the per-`ℓ`
determinant congruence is this self-contained arithmetic, with **no** elliptic-curve content.

Reference: Silverman, *The Arithmetic of Elliptic Curves*, V.2.3.1 (the integer equality `det = deg`
is pinned by reducing modulo infinitely many `ℓ`).

/-- **An integer divisible by every prime `ℓ ≠ p` is zero.**

The arithmetic core of the Route-2 endgame: a nonzero integer has only finitely many prime
divisors, but there are infinitely many primes `≠ p`, so if every such prime divides `D` then
`D = 0`.  (Witness: choose a prime `ℓ ≥ max(|D|+1, p+1)`; it is `≠ p` and exceeds `|D|`, yet
`ℓ ∣ D` forces `ℓ ≤ |D|` when `D ≠ 0`.) -/

/-- **Integer equality from mod-`ℓ` congruences for all primes `ℓ ≠ p`.**

If `A ≡ B (mod ℓ)` (as elements of `ZMod ℓ`) for every prime `ℓ ≠ p`, then `A = B` as integers.
This is the Route-2 endgame: with `A = deg(rπ − s)` and `B = qr² − t·rs + s²`, the per-`ℓ`
determinant–degree congruence from the finite-level Weil pairing forces the integer identity. -/
