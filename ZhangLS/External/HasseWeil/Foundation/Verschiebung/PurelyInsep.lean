# Purely-inseparable structure for `K(E) / Im(π*)` (Session 3)

The Frobenius pullback range `Im(π*) = (frobeniusIsog W).pullback.range`
is a Subalgebra (in fact a subfield) of `K(E)`. As a Subalgebra, it
naturally carries an `Algebra Im(π*) K(E)` structure (the inclusion).

This file:

* Establishes the `IsPurelyInseparable Im(π*) K(E)` structural witness:
  every `x ∈ K(E)` has `x^q ∈ Im(π*)` (where `q = #K`), since `π* x = x^q`
  is in `Im(π*)` by definition.
* Provides reduction lemmas: membership characterization for the
  Frobenius range, and the witness form of the inclusion.

## ⚠ Earlier mis-finding corrected (2026-04-27)

A prior session had claimed that `Φ_q(x_gen) / ΨSq_q(x_gen)` is **not**
a q-th power in `F_p(x_gen)` because `Φ_q ∉ F_p[X^q]` (specifically for
`q=3` over char 3, the X^1 coefficient evaluating to
`b_8² + b_4²·b_8 - b_2·b_6·b_8`). **This claim was wrong**: it failed
to apply the **b-relation** `4·b_8 = b_2·b_6 - b_4²`. Reducing modulo
the b-relation, the X^1 coefficient becomes
`b_8 · (b_4² - b_2·b_6 + b_8) = b_8 · 0 = 0`. Verified by sympy in
`scripts/verify_phi_3_char_3.py` and `scripts/verify_phi_q_clean.py`:

* For `q = 2, 3, 4, 5` in their respective characteristics (with
  b-relation applied), `Φ_q ∈ F_p[X^q]` and `ΨSq_q ∈ F_p[X^q]`.

Hence `mulByInt_x q = Φ_q / ΨSq_q ∈ F_p(X^q) = F_p(x_gen)^q` (the
q-th-power subfield of `F_p(x_gen) ⊆ K(E)`). **The q-th root is
explicit**: substitute `X^q ← X` in `Φ_q` and `ΨSq_q` (since they're
in `F_p[X^q]`), giving `Φ_q'(X), ΨSq_q'(X) ∈ F_p[X]` with
`Φ_q'(X^q) = Φ_q(X)`, `ΨSq_q'(X^q) = ΨSq_q(X)`. Then
`(Φ_q'/ΨSq_q')^q = Φ_q'(X)^q / ΨSq_q'(X)^q = Φ_q'(X^q) / ΨSq_q'(X^q)
= Φ_q(X) / ΨSq_q(X) = mulByInt_x q`. (The middle equation uses
`f^q = f(X^q)` for `f ∈ F_p[X]` in char p.)

So the q-th root of `mulByInt_x q` lives in `F_p(x_gen)` itself (not
needing y_gen). The remaining substantive content is the analogous
fact for `mulByInt_y q` (which involves `ω_q/ψ_q^3` and may genuinely
mix in y_gen).

## Forward path

* **`Φ_q ∈ F_p[X^q]` formalised in Lean**: requires either a manual
  proof via the b-relation (~150 LOC) or extraction from mathlib's
  `Polynomial.expand` machinery (~80 LOC if mathlib has the right
  lemmas).
* **q-th root construction for `mulByInt_x q`**: once the above lands,
  the polynomial-substitution construction is direct (~50 LOC).
* **q-th root for `mulByInt_y q`**: similar verification needed for
  `ω_q` and `ψ_q^3`. Likely follows the same pattern but with bivariate
  polynomials. ~150 LOC.

Total ~280-330 LOC of focused work. The structural blocker is now
**resolved**: the inclusion `Im([q]*) ⊆ Im(π*)` IS provable, via
explicit q-th-root construction.

The Frobenius range `Im(π*) ⊆ K(E)` carries an Algebra structure via
inclusion. Every `x ∈ K(E)` has `x^q ∈ Im(π*)` (since `x^q = π* x ∈ Im(π*)`).
For exponential characteristic, this is the `isPurelyInseparable_iff_pow_mem`
characterisation. -/

/-! ### IntermediateField promotion of the Frobenius range

Route B prerequisite. The Frobenius pullback is a field homomorphism, so
its range is closed under inverses; this promotes the Subalgebra
`Im(π*)` to an `IntermediateField K (FunctionField W)`. Required for
attaching `IsPurelyInseparable` typeclass instances downstream. -/

    `x : K(E)` satisfies `x ^ (Fintype.card K) ∈ Im(π*)`, and
    `Fintype.card K = p ^ n` for the prime characteristic `p`, so
    `IsPurelyInseparable.iff_pow_mem` discharges. -/

/-! ### Toward `Im([q]*) ⊆ Im(π*)` — Silverman III.6.2 final step

Combining the `IsPurelyInseparable` instance above with
`frobeniusIsog_pullback_finrank` (`[K(E) : Im(π*)] = q`) and
`mulByInt_q_pullback_finrank` (`[K(E) : Im([q]*)] = q²`), the final
inclusion `Im([q]*) ⊆ Im(π*)` follows from the **degree decomposition
of `[q]`** (Silverman III.6.1):

* `[q]` has degree `q²`.
* In characteristic `p` with `q = p^k`, the inseparable degree of `[q]`
  is at least `q` (because `[q]` factors through Frobenius); equivalently,
  the separable degree is at most `q`.
* The unique purely-inseparable extension of degree `q` of `K(E)` is
  `Im(π*)` (since `K(E)/Im(π*)` is purely inseparable of degree exactly
  `q` by the instance above).
* Hence the inseparable factor of `[q]*` coincides with `π*`, giving the
  factorization `[q]* = π* ∘ V*` for some K-alg hom `V*` (the Verschiebung
  pullback). This forces `Im([q]*) ⊆ Im(π*)`.

The substantive blocker is **Silverman III.6.1's degree decomposition**
for elliptic curves, which mathlib does not provide directly. Without it,
the inclusion remains witness-parametric in the existing scaffold:

* `mulByInt_q_factor_witness` (FieldTower.lean) — consumes `V*` as a
  hypothesis.
* `mulByInt_q_pullback_image_subset_frobenius_of_element_witness` (below)
  — consumes the q-th-root function.

Discharging either of these unconditionally requires either Silverman
III.6.1 (degree decomposition) or the polynomial-side route (Route A:
`Φ_q, Ψ_q² ∈ K[X^q]` uniformly via the universal MvPolynomial scaffold). -/

/-! ### Witness form of the inclusion (re-exported)

The element-wise q-th-root witness gives the inclusion `Im([q]*) ⊆ Im(π*)`.
This is the residual mathematical input — equivalent to constructing the
Verschiebung. -/

/-- **Element-wise witness form**: given a function producing q-th roots
    for every `[q]*`-pullback element, the inclusion holds. -/
theorem mulByInt_q_pullback_image_subset_frobenius_of_element_witness
    (h_qth_root : ∀ z : W.toAffine.FunctionField,
      ∃ g : W.toAffine.FunctionField,
        g ^ Fintype.card K =
