# Pic⁰(E) ≅ E for elliptic curves: σ and κ maps

Following Silverman III.3.4, this file builds the σ "sum-of-points" map
on degree-zero projective divisors of an elliptic Weierstrass curve, plus
the inverse `κ : E → Pic⁰(E)`, `P ↦ class of (P) − (O)`, and the basic
API.

The full bijection `σ̄ : Pic⁰(E) ≅ E` is gated on `T-III-3-003` (worker-K)
which provides the "(P) ~ (Q) ⇒ P = Q" half. This file delivers
everything that does NOT depend on `T-III-3-003`. See
`.mathlib-quality/tickets/picard/` for the Pic⁰-route ticket roadmap.

## Main definitions

* `Curves.ProjectiveSmoothPoint.toAffinePoint` — bridge from a projective
  smooth point to mathlib's `Affine.Point` (`infinity ↦ 0`).
* `Curves.projectiveDivisorSum` — the σ map: `Σ nᵢ (Pᵢ) ↦ Σ nᵢ • Pᵢ`
  using the elliptic-curve group law.
* `Curves.projectiveDivisorSumHom` — the σ map bundled as an
  `AddMonoidHom`.

/-! #### `(P) + (−P) − 2·(O)` family

The divisor `(P) + (−P) − 2·(∞)` is principal on `E` (it is the divisor
of `x − x(P)`, the vertical line through `P`). Without identifying which
function it is the divisor of, we can directly verify that σ vanishes on
this family — `P + (−P) − 2·O = 0` in `W.Point` by the abelian-group
identity `P + (−P) = 0`.

This is the simplest non-trivial family of principal divisors with
verifiable σ-vanishing, and it provides a concrete "sanity check"
demonstration that σ does annihilate at least some non-trivial principal
divisors. Per Silverman III.3.4 + III.3.5, every divisor of a vertical
line `x − x_0` for an `F`-rational `x_0` lies in this family. -/
