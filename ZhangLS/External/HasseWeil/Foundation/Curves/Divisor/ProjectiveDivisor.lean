# Projective divisors on a smooth plane curve

The projective divisor group `ProjectiveDivisor C` extends the affine
`Divisor C` (free abelian group on `C.SmoothPoint`) by adjoining a single
place at infinity. For a smooth plane curve given by a Weierstrass
equation, the projective closure has a unique point at infinity
`[0 : 1 : 0]`, and the corresponding additive valuation is
`SmoothPlaneCurve.ordAtInfty : F(C) → WithTop ℤ` defined in
`HasseWeil/Curves/Infinity.lean`.

## Main definitions

* `ProjectiveSmoothPoint C` — inductive type with constructors `affine P`
  (for `P : C.SmoothPoint`) and `infinity`.
* `ProjectiveDivisor C` — finite `ℤ`-linear combinations of
  `ProjectiveSmoothPoint` (as a `Finsupp`).
* `ProjectiveDivisor.degree`, `ProjectiveDivisor.degreeHom` — the degree
  map with its additive-group-hom packaging.
* `Divisor.toProjective` — the embedding of the affine divisor group into
  `ProjectiveDivisor C`.
* `SmoothPlaneCurve.projectiveDivisorOf f` — the projective divisor of a
  rational function, combining `divisorOf` with `ordAtInfty`.
* `SmoothPlaneCurve.projPrincipalSubgroup`, `PicProj`, `PicProj₀` — the
  principal subgroup and the (degree-zero) Picard group on the projective
  closure.

## Main results

* `projectiveDivisorOf_mul`, `projectiveDivisorOf_inv` — multiplicativity of
  the projective divisor map on nonzero functions.
* `projectiveDivisorOf_degree` — the structural decomposition
  `deg = (divisorOf f).degree + (ordAtInfty f).untopD 0`.

## Future work

* Silverman II.3.1(b): `deg(projectiveDivisorOf f) = 0` for nonzero `f`,
  unconditionally (currently proved only in the Helper-B-factored form
  `projectiveDivisorOf_degree_eq_zero_of_helperB`).

/- The `RatFunc F` product formula (under `[IsAlgClosed F]`): for `g : RatFunc F` with `F`
algebraically closed, `intDegree g` is the signed sum of root multiplicities (numerator minus
denominator). Combined with the future Helper B (`v_a(N(f)) = Σ_{P : P.x = a} ord_P f`), this
yields `projectiveDivisorOf_degree_zero` (Silverman II.3.1(b)) via
`ordAtInfty f = -intDegree(N f)`. -/
