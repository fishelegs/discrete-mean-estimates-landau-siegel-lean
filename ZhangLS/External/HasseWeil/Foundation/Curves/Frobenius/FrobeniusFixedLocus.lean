# Frobenius fixed locus in the algebraic closure of a finite field

For a finite field `K` with `q = Fintype.card K` elements, an element of the algebraic
closure `AlgebraicClosure K` is fixed by the `q`-power map (the arithmetic Frobenius) iff it
lies in the image of `K`:

```
a ^ q = a  ↔  a ∈ Set.range (algebraMap K (AlgebraicClosure K))
```

This is the elementary field-theoretic input to Route B (Silverman V.1): the `K`-rational
points are exactly the fixed points of Frobenius.

## Main results

* `HasseWeil.range_algebraMap_eq_roots_X_pow_card_sub_X`: the image of `K` in the algebraic
  closure is exactly the (finset of) roots of `X ^ q - X`.
* `HasseWeil.frobenius_fixed_iff_mem_baseField`: `a ^ q = a ↔ a ∈ range (algebraMap …)`.

## Strategy

`X ^ q - X` over `L = AlgebraicClosure K` is separable (its derivative is `-1`, because
`(q : L) = 0`), has `natDegree = q`, and splits (`L` is algebraically closed); hence it has
exactly `q` distinct roots. The `q` images of `K` under `algebraMap` are distinct
(`algebraMap` is injective) and are all roots (`FiniteField.pow_card`), so they are *all* the
roots. The fixed-point characterisation follows since `a ^ q = a` iff `a` is a root.
