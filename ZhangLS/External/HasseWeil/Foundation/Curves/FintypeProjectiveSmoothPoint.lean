# `Fintype` instance for `ProjectiveSmoothPoint`

The projective smooth points on `W : WeierstrassCurve F` are in canonical
bijection with `W.toAffine.Point`:

* `0 : W.toAffine.Point` ↔ `ProjectiveSmoothPoint.infinity`
* `Point.some x y h` ↔ `ProjectiveSmoothPoint.affine ⟨x, y, h⟩`

The bridge `Affine.Point.toProjectiveSmoothPoint` (`Curves/PicZero.lean:136`)
and its inverse `ProjectiveSmoothPoint.toAffinePoint` (`Curves/PicZero.lean:44`)
realise this bijection. The round-trip `toProjectiveSmoothPoint_toAffinePoint`
is shipped in `PicZero.lean:153`; the reverse round-trip is shipped here.

As a corollary, `Fintype W.toAffine.Point` (which the project supplies via
the `pointCount` machinery) transports to `Fintype (ProjectiveSmoothPoint
⟨W.toAffine⟩)`, and the two cardinalities agree:

  `Fintype.card (ProjectiveSmoothPoint ⟨W.toAffine⟩) = pointCount W.toAffine`

(NO `+1`: `W.toAffine.Point` already includes the basepoint `0` corresponding
to the point at infinity.)
