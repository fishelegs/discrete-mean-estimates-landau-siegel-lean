# Auxiliary order and leading coefficient lemmas for Hahn series

This file contains auxiliary lemmas for orders and leading coefficients of inverses and
quotients of Hahn series.

* `HahnSeries.orderTop_inv_eq_neg` — `(s⁻¹).orderTop = −s.orderTop` for
  nonzero `s` in a HahnSeries over a field.
* `HahnSeries.orderTop_div` — the division analogue.
* `HahnSeries.leadingCoeff_inv` — the leading coefficient analogue for inverses.
* `HahnSeries.leadingCoeff_div` — the leading coefficient analogue for quotients.
