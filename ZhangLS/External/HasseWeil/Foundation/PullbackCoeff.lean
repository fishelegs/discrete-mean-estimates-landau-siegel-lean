# The Pullback Coefficient and Dual Additivity (Silverman III.5.6, III.6.2c)

For an endomorphism φ of an elliptic curve E, the pullback coefficient `a_φ`
is the unique scalar such that `D(φ*(x)) = a_φ · D(x)` in the Kähler
differential module `Ω[K(E)/F]`, which is 1-dimensional over `K(E)`.

The map φ ↦ a_φ is a ring homomorphism End(E) → K(E) (Silverman Cor. III.5.6).

## Key Properties

* a_{[m]} = m (Silverman Cor. III.5.3)
* a_{φ+ψ} = a_φ + a_ψ (from (φ+ψ)*ω = φ*ω + ψ*ω, Thm III.5.2)
* a_{φ∘ψ} = a_φ · a_ψ (chain rule on pullbacks)
* a_φ = 0 ⟺ φ is inseparable (Silverman IV.4.2c)

## Dual Additivity

From φ̂∘φ = [deg φ]: a_{φ̂} · a_φ = deg(φ), giving a_{φ̂} = deg(φ)/a_φ.
Combined with additivity, the algebraic identity `dual_additivity_algebraic`
gives (φ+ψ)^ = φ̂+ψ̂ (Silverman III.6.2c).

## Construction

The definition uses `kaehler_rank_one` (from FormalGroupCorrespondence.lean)
which proves `finrank_{K(E)} Ω[K(E)/F] = 1`. Combined with `D_x_ne_zero`
(from InvariantDifferential.lean), the element `D(x)` is a nonzero element
of a 1-dimensional vector space, so any element `D(α*(x))` can be uniquely
written as `c · D(x)`. The pullback coefficient is this scalar `c`.

/-! ### The pullback coefficient as a concrete definition

For a general endomorphism, the pullback coefficient is defined via
Kähler differentials: `Ω[K(E)/F]` is 1-dimensional over `K(E)` (genus 1,
proved as `kaehler_rank_one`), so for any endomorphism pullback `α*`,
`D(α*(x)) = c · D(x)` for a unique `c ∈ K(E)`.

The scalar `c` is extracted using `exists_smul_eq_of_finrank_eq_one`
applied to `kaehler_rank_one` and `D_x_ne_zero`.

/-- The pullback coefficient `a_α` for an endomorphism isogeny `α : E → E`.

    Defined as the unique element `c ∈ K(E)` such that
    `D(α*(x)) = c • D(x)` in `Ω[K(E)/F]`.

    This exists and is unique because:
    - `Ω[K(E)/F]` is 1-dimensional (`kaehler_rank_one`)
    - `D(x) ≠ 0` (`D_x_ne_zero`)

    NOTE: This gives a K(E)-valued coefficient, not an F-valued one.
    The Silverman convention uses the invariant differential ω, giving
    an F-valued coefficient. The D(x)-based coefficient differs by a
    factor of α*(u)/u where u = 2y+a₁x+a₃.

    The chain rule `a_{α∘β} = a_α · a_β` holds for the ω-based coefficient
    (Silverman III.5.6). For the D(x)-based coefficient, the chain rule
    requires additional infrastructure (formal group correspondence).

    Proof sketch: [n]*ω = nω by induction using (φ+ψ)*ω = φ*ω + ψ*ω.
    Equivalently, the formal group series [n]_F(T) = nT + O(T²)
    (Silverman Prop. IV.2.3a).

    The proof requires showing that the division polynomial pullback of [n]
    acts on x_gen as the rational function Φ_n/ΨSq_n, and that applying D
    to this via the quotient rule gives n · D(x) at the generic point. -/

/-- `a_{φ∘ψ} = a_φ · a_ψ`. Reference: Silverman III.5.6(a).

    The proof requires the pullback coefficient to be in F (the base field),
    not just K(E). This follows from the invariant differential having no
    zeros or poles (Silverman III.1.5), making φ*(ω)/ω a constant.

    With a_α ∈ F: (α∘β)*(ω) = β*(α*(ω)) = β*(a_α·ω) = a_α·β*(ω) = a_α·a_β·ω.
    (The semilinear pullback β* fixes F-scalars: β*(c·ω) = β*(c)·β*(ω) = c·β*(ω) for c ∈ F.)

    The current definition via D(x) computes a_α ∈ K(E), not F. To complete
    this proof, either:
    (a) Show isogPullbackCoeff W α ∈ range(algebraMap F K(E)), or
    (b) Redefine via the invariant differential, or
    (c) Use the formal group → curve correspondence (Silverman IV.4).

    All three approaches require substantial new infrastructure (divisor theory,
    formal group identification, or constant function characterization). -/

/-- From `α_dual ∘ α = [deg α]`: `a_{α_dual} · a_α = deg(α)`.
    This follows from multiplicativity and `a_{[n]} = n`.

    Witness-parametric: the dual is supplied explicitly as `α_dual` together
    with the composition identity `h_dual` (the choice-based `isogDual` is
    gone — its underlying `exists_dual` was refuted; see `DualIsogeny.lean`).

    We require `hdual_base : isogPullbackCoeff W α_dual = algebraMap F _
    c_dual` (the dual's pullback coefficient is a constant). This hypothesis
    is an unconditional fact (Silverman III.1.5: invariant differential has
    no zeros/poles, so `α*ω/ω ∈ F`) but is not yet formalized in our
    codebase. -/

/-! ### Dual additivity (Silverman III.6.2c) -/

/-- **Silverman III.6.2c**: (φ+ψ)^ = φ̂+ψ̂ at the level of pullback coefficients.

    From the pullback coefficient properties:
    - a_{(φ+ψ)^} = deg(φ+ψ) / a_{φ+ψ} = deg(φ+ψ) / (a_φ + a_ψ)
    - a_{φ̂+ψ̂} = a_{φ̂} + a_{ψ̂} = deg(φ)/a_φ + deg(ψ)/a_ψ

    These are equal by the algebraic identity `dual_additivity_algebraic`
    (proved in FormalGroupAssoc.lean).

    Since φ ↦ a_φ is injective on separable endomorphisms, this gives
    (φ+ψ)^ = φ̂+ψ̂. -/
