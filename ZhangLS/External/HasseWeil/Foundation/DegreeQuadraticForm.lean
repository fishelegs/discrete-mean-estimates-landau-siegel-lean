# Degree as a Positive Definite Quadratic Form

The degree map on endomorphism isogenies of an elliptic curve is a positive
definite quadratic form (Silverman Corollary III.6.3).

## Main Result

For any endomorphism isogeny `α` with degree `d` and trace `t`, and integers `r, s`:

  `deg(r · α - s · 1) = d · r² - t · r · s + s²`

Since degree is non-negative (it is a natural number), this makes the
associated bilinear form positive semi-definite.

## Proof Structure

The proof uses the witness-parametric dual-isogeny language from
`DualIsogeny.lean` (`IsDualOf`; the universal `exists_dual` and the
choice-based `isogDual` cascade were refuted and deleted — see that file's
module docstring):
1. dual composition `α_dual ∘ α = [deg α]` (hypothesis `h_dual_comp`);
2. dual additivity at the `AddMonoidHom` level (`dual_add_of_trace_witnesses`);
3. the trace identity `α + α_dual = [tr α]` (hypothesis `h_sum_trace`).

From these, pointwise arithmetic on E.Point gives the expansion.

    Given:

      `α_dual ∘ α = [deg α]` holding at the `toAddMonoidHom` level
      (hypothesis `h_dual_comp`);

/-! ### Degree quadratic form — III.6.3

The bare `degree_quadratic` and `degree_quadratic_nonneg` theorems were
removed as part of the qf_nonneg migration (audit findings F2/F3,
`.mathlib-quality/isogeny-compatibility-audit.md`). Their original shape
asserted `(β.degree : ℤ) = (α.degree : ℤ) * r ^ 2 - …` for any `β` with the
right `toAddMonoidHom`. With the placeholder `isogSmulSub` (pullback :=
`AlgHom.id`, degree = 1) used as the canonical `β`, the equality was
structurally false at `(r, s) = (0, 0)` — the lemma was a `sorry` on a
false statement, and the consequence `_nonneg` likewise inherited an
unsound conclusion under the placeholder.

The witness-parametric replacements remain:

* `degree_quadratic_nonneg_of_witness` — same `_nonneg` conclusion, but
  takes the III.6.3 equality as an explicit hypothesis, sound regardless
  of the supplied `β`.
* `traceOfFrobenius_sq_le_of_qf_nonneg` (`Hasse/BoundOfWitnesses.lean`) —
  routes the discriminant bound through pure ℤ-arithmetic and bypasses
  any isogeny-degree assertion entirely. -/

/-- **Parametric form of III.6.3**: given the degree equality as hypothesis,
    the quadratic form non-negativity is immediate (since `β.degree : ℕ`).

    This version is closable without requiring the III.6.3 proof. The
    hypothesis `h_deg_eq` is what `degree_quadratic` would prove; callers
    that have access to a witness (e.g. via the dual isogeny chain) can
    use this directly. -/

/-! ### Dual-chain consumers (step 4 of the Hasse-bound closure plan)

The `degree_quadratic` sorry above is gated on the Silverman III.6 chain
(T-III-6-001 dual existence, T-III-6-005 dual additivity, III.8 trace
formula). The consumer theorems below expose the exact bridge from the
III.6 outputs to the degree identity, one witness at a time, so the
entire chain becomes drop-in once either Route A (kernel factorization,
step 3) or Route D (formal-group bridge, T-IV-BRIDGE-003) lands.

Witness-to-ticket map:

| Hypothesis | Silverman | Ticket |
|------------|-----------|--------|
| `h_comp` | III.6.1 (β̂∘β = [deg β]) | T-III-6-003 |
| `h_dual_deg` | III.6.2(a) (deg β̂ = deg β) | T-III-6-007 |
| `hβ_dual_spec` | III.6.1 as IsDualOf | T-III-6-001 |

Once those three drop, the β.degree² identity emerges algebraically. -/

/-- **SIGNED degree extraction via Wall C (SUB-PIV-D)**:
given that `β.comp α = mulByInt E N` as a FULL ISOGENY equality (not just
AddMonoidHom), and that `IsDualOf β α` (so `β.comp α = mulByInt α.degree`),
conclude `α.degree = N` SIGNED via Wall C (`mulByInt_left_injective`).

This is the non-circular signed extraction that bypasses
`degree_quadratic_of_dualChain_witnesses`'s `h_nonneg_N` hypothesis. Once a
producer ships the substantive `β.comp α = mulByInt E N` at the full
isogeny level (the SUB-PIV-C2 content), this lemma immediately delivers
the SIGNED III.6.3 identity without circularity.

`r·α − s·id` family, witness-parametric on the substantive pivot inputs.

Given:
- `α` (= π, the Frobenius)
- `β_dual` (= rV − s, the V-side genuine isogeny)
- `β` (= rπ − s, the π-side genuine isogeny)
- `IsDualOf β_dual β` (the substantive new content from SUB-PIV-C / Pic⁰ pivot)
- `β_dual.comp β = mulByInt W.toAffine N` (the full-isogeny composition equality)

This composes `signed_degree_of_isDualOf_and_comp_eq` for the genuine isogeny
family. Once SUB-PIV-C2 ships the `IsDualOf` + `comp_eq` witnesses
unconditionally over `L = AlgebraicClosure K` and descent to K, this becomes
the unconditional GAP-QF leaf.

    This is the content of Silverman III.6 applied at the composition

/-! ### Degree-level variants (weaker hypotheses)

The theorems above need the Isogeny-level equality `β_dual.comp β = mulByInt E N`,
which pins down both the `toAddMonoidHom` and the `pullback` of the composition.
Downstream dual-chain producers (whether via Route A kernel factorization or
Route D formal-group bridge) most naturally yield a *degree-level* identity
`(β_dual.comp β).degree = (mulByInt E N).degree`, which is strictly weaker.

This section exposes variants of the dual-chain consumer that only need
degree-level witnesses. They are proof-step-shorter to produce: the caller
just has to arrange that the composition's extension degree matches
`(N²).toNat`, rather than matching the full `mulByInt E N` isogeny.

The relations between the forms:

* `comp_degree`: `(ψ.comp φ).degree = φ.degree * ψ.degree`
* `mulByInt_degree`: `(mulByInt E N).degree = (N²).toNat` for `N ≠ 0`

So `(β_dual.comp β).degree = β.degree * β_dual.degree`, and the degree-level
witness becomes `β.degree * β_dual.degree = (N²).toNat`. -/

/-- **Degree-level variant of `sq_degree_eq_sq_of_dual_comp_witness`**
    (step 4a, weakened): only needs the product `β.degree · β_dual.degree`
    equal to `(N²).toNat`. This is what `comp_degree` would produce from a
    composition-level isogeny equality, so it's strictly weaker than the
    Isogeny-level hypothesis. -/

The theorem `degree_quadratic_closed` below is the **composite witness-parametric
call site** that closes the `degree_quadratic` identity from a complete bundle
of III.6 witnesses at the `AddMonoidHom` level plus the `toAddMonoidHom → degree`
bridge for the specific isogenies involved.

This is the form the Stream D brief describes as the final call site:
downstream workers delivering:
* `α_dual` — a witness dual for α (Route A kernel factorization, or Route D
  formal-group bridge)
* `hβ_hom`, `hβ_dual_hom` — β, β_dual in the r·α − s / r·α_dual − s forms
* `h_dual_comp` — α_dual ∘ α = [deg α] at the `AddMonoidHom` level (III.6.1
  content)
* `h_sum_trace` — α + α_dual = [tr α] at the `AddMonoidHom` level (III.8.6
  content via `dual_add_of_trace_witnesses`)
* `h_deg_bridge` — the `toAddMonoidHom ↔ degree` bridge for β_dual ∘ β and
  [N] (provided separately by Route A uniqueness of pullback, or by the
  Formal-Group bridge)
* `h_dual_deg` — β_dual.degree = β.degree (III.6.2(a) content from
  `degree_dual_of_witness`)
* `h_nonneg_N` — the QF value is ≥ 0 (algebraic)

gets the full Silverman III.6.3 identity. All four upstream tickets
(T-III-6-001, T-III-6-003, T-III-6-005, T-III-6-007) become drop-in once

/-! ### Polarisation identity for genuine `addIsog`-built isogenies — Silverman III.6.3

The witness-parametric closers `degree_quadratic_closed` /
`isogSmulSub_degree_quadratic_closed` deliver the III.6.3 degree identity for
*any* `β` whose `toAddMonoidHom` matches `r·α − s·id` and whose dual matches
`r·α̂ − s·id`. The placeholder `isogSmulSub` (`Endomorphism.lean`) supplies the
correct `toAddMonoidHom` but a trivial `pullback := AlgHom.id` — which makes the
`h_deg_bridge` hypothesis structurally false at `(r,s) = (0,0)` and the
non-negativity hypothesis vacuous.

The genuine `r·α − s·id` isogeny is `addIsog` of `(α.zsmul r, mulByInt E (-s))`
(`AdditionPullback.lean`): its pullback is the genuine algebra-hom pullback
witness-parametric on `AddNonInversePair` and injectivity of the coordinate
algebra hom. With the Frobenius case `α = π`, Worker B's D3b output supplies
`AddNonInversePair (π.zsmul r) (mulByInt (-s))` axiom-clean, and Worker C's
Verschiebung output supplies the dual chain (V dual of π, sum-trace, dual-deg).

The theorem below is the **specialisation of `degree_quadratic_closed` to the
addIsog-built `β` family**: it auto-discharges the `hβ_hom`/`hβ_dual_hom`
hypotheses via `addIsog_toAddMonoidHom`, leaving only the genuine III.6 inputs
(dual-comp, sum-trace, dual-deg, deg-bridge, nonneg) for downstream consumers
to deliver. -/

/-! ### Trace identity from the dual chain (Silverman III.6.2(b), Hasse case)

The polarisation chain consumes `h_sum_trace : α + α_dual = [tr α]` at the
`toAddMonoidHom` level. Silverman derives this from the III.6.2(b) bilinear
pairing argument; for the Hasse-critical case (α = π Frobenius, α_dual = V
Verschiebung) the substantive ingredient is

  `(1 − α) ∘ (1 − α_dual) = [deg(1 − α)]`   (at hom level)

Combined with the dual-composition halves `α_dual ∘ α = α ∘ α_dual = [deg α]`,
the bilinear expansion `(1 − α)(1 − α_dual) = [1] − α − α_dual + α α_dual`
reduces directly to `α + α_dual = [1 + deg α − deg(1 − α)] = [tr α]`. The
bridge below packages this algebra as a single drop-in identity, avoiding the
need to prove universal dual additivity (long-term Silverman track per
reviewer Q5). -/

/-- **Trace identity from the dual chain (Silverman III.6.2(b), Hasse case)**:
    given the dual-composition half `α ∘ α_dual = [deg α]` (one half of
    `IsDualOf α_dual α`) plus the III.6.2(b) substantive identity
    `(1 − α) ∘ (1 − α_dual) = [deg(1 − α)]` at `toAddMonoidHom` level,
    conclude

      `α + α_dual = [1 + deg α − deg(1 − α)] = [tr α]`

    at `toAddMonoidHom` level. This is the trace identity consumed by
    `degree_quadratic_closed` / `degree_quadratic_genuine_addIsog` as
    `h_sum_trace`.

    The substantive hypothesis `h_one_sub_one_sub_dual` is the III.6.2(b)
    content for the Hasse-critical case — Worker C's Frobenius-specific
    dual chain plus the genuine `1 − π` isogeny
    (`isogOneSub_negFrobenius W hq` in `AdditionPullback/Frobenius.lean`)
    discharge it without needing universal dual additivity. -/

/-- **Silverman III.6.3 polarisation identity, genuine `addIsog` form**: for the
    genuine `r·α − s·id` isogeny `addIsog hxy_β hinj_β` (with α₁ = α.zsmul r,
    α₂ = mulByInt (-s)) and a corresponding `addIsog`-built `r·α_dual − s·id`,
    given the standard Silverman III.6 inputs (dual composition, sum trace,
    dual-degree equality, degree bridge, QF non-negativity) the III.6.3
    identity

      `(addIsog hxy_β hinj_β).degree = (α.degree)·r² − (tr α)·rs + s²`

    holds at the integer level.

    Drop-in form: once Worker B's D-track ships `hxy_β/hinj_β` axiom-clean (and
    the analogous V-pair from Worker C), this becomes the unconditional general-α
    polarisation identity, replacing the deleted false `degree_quadratic`.
