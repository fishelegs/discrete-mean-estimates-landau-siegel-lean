# The division-polynomial Wronskian over a general field (axiom-clean, downstream route)

The **division-polynomial Wronskian identity** (Silverman Exercise III.3.7)

  `Φ_n' · ΨSq_n − Φ_n · ΨSq_n' = n · preΨ_{2n}`   in `F[X]`

is proved in `HasseWeil/OmegaPullbackCoeff.lean` (`wronskian_Φ_ΨSq`) by strong induction on `n`,
but the `n ≥ 5` inductive step needs the **EDS addition formula** (Ward's relation), which mathlib
does not currently provide. That proof therefore carries a `sorryAx` taint.

This file gives an **axiom-clean** proof of the same polynomial identity (for `n ≠ 0`) by routing
**downstream** through the function field, avoiding the EDS addition formula entirely. The chain is:

1. The **general-field differential** `a_{[n]} = n`
   (`HasseWeil.omegaCoeff_mulByInt`, finite-field free, proved by the
   Route-B chord recurrence — no EDS Wronskian).
2. The bridge `divPoly_wronskian_identity_of_omega` turns `a_{[n]} = n` into the **K(E)-level**
   Wronskian `(Φ' ΨSq − Φ ΨSq') · u = n · ΨSq² · α*u`.
3. The bridge `preΨ_two_mul_u_eq_ΨSq_sq_mul_alpha_star_u` rewrites `ΨSq² · α*u = preΨ_{2n} · u`,
   collapsing the right-hand side to `n · preΨ_{2n} · u`.
4. Cancelling the nonzero `u = u_gen` (`u_gen_ne_zero`) leaves an equality of
   `algebraMap (Polynomial F) KE`-images of two polynomials; by **injectivity** of that algebra map
   (`x_gen` transcendental: `IsFractionRing.injective` composed with
   `Affine.CoordinateRing.algebraMap_poly_injective`) the identity descends to `F[X]`.

The two bridge lemmas (2,3) and `omegaCoeff_mulByInt` (1) are all axiom-clean, so the resulting
polynomial Wronskian is axiom-clean. It is the EDS-free replacement for `wronskian_Φ_ΨSq` consumed
by the affine unramifiedness lemma `ord_P_mulByInt_x_sub_const_eq_one`
(`HasseWeil/EC/MulByIntUnramified.lean`).

/-- **The division-polynomial Wronskian identity over a general field, axiom-clean.**

`Φ_n' · ΨSq_n − Φ_n · ΨSq_n' = n · preΨ_{2n}` as polynomials in `F[X]` (Silverman Exercise III.3.7),
for `n ≠ 0`.

Unlike `HasseWeil.wronskian_Φ_ΨSq` (which proves this by strong induction whose `n ≥ 5` step needs
the unavailable EDS addition formula, hence `sorryAx`), this proof routes through the function
field: the general-field differential `a_{[n]} = n` (`omegaCoeff_mulByInt`, Route-B, EDS-free), K(E)
Wronskian bridge (`divPoly_wronskian_identity_of_omega`) and the `preΨ`/`u` bridge
(`preΨ_two_mul_u_eq_ΨSq_sq_mul_alpha_star_u`), then cancellation of `u_gen` and injectivity of
`algebraMap (Polynomial F) KE`. It is therefore axiom-clean. -/
